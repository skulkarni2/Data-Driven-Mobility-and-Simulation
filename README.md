# Data-Driven-Mobility-and-Simulation
Spring 2017 
The goal of this course is to provide students with the tools and methods to understand basics of traffic flow theory, modeling and simulation. The emphasis will be on the use of real-world data to supplement the
understanding of the theory behind the models. Small-scale models will be developed, tested and validated
against real-world data. 
Tools and techniques used - 
R, NetLogo, Simmer, Simuation of Urban Mobility (SUMO)
